# University Campus Network System

This project simulates a university campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It is designed to demonstrate a structured and efficient networking environment suitable for a university setting, including inter-department communication, internet access, and VLAN segmentation.

## 🛠️ Features

- Structured layout of different university departments
- Interconnected routers and switches
- End devices like PCs, servers, and wireless devices
- VLAN configuration for segmentation and security
- Static or dynamic routing setup
- DHCP and DNS server implementation (if applicable)
- Internet simulation using cloud module

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt` file)
- Routers and switches (Layer 2/3)
- PCs and servers
- VLANs (optional)
- DHCP, DNS (optional)
- Cabling and IP addressing scheme

## 🗂️ File

- `projectFile.pkt` – Main Packet Tracer file containing the complete network topology

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (version 8.0 or later recommended).
2. Clone this repository or download the `.pkt` file.
3. Open the `.pkt` file with Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Explore the network topology, device configurations, and test connectivity.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the design of a scalable and secure campus network
- Practice configuring devices in Cisco Packet Tracer
- Learn VLAN setup and routing techniques
- Simulate real-world university network scenarios
